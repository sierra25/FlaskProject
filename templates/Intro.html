<h1>Hi, My Name Is Sierra Lovejoy ðŸ˜Š</h1>
<p>
    I am a Computer Science major with a minor in applied mathematics. I am currently 23 years old.
    I am in my Senior year and currently have an Associates in Engineering and am now pursuing a
    Bachelor's in computer science from Texas State. I plan to pursue a career in software development after graduating.
    My class year to graduate is Spring 2022. In the future I hope to create websites and applications that help peopleâ€™s
    daily lives and to work on projects that add convenience and impact people in positive ways.My hobbies include
    gardening, cooking and putting together jigsaw puzzles.
